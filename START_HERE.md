# Welcome to CCCGroup and 01Founders CodeLab!

This `content` folder is designed to help you get started and navigate your way through the project. Think of it as your personal guide to understanding the codebase, contributing effectively, and finding important information.

## How to use this folder:

1.  **Start Here:** You're already doing it! This `00_START_HERE.md` file provides a general overview.
2.  **Explore:** Browse through other Markdown files (`.md`) in this directory. They will contain detailed instructions, guides, and important notes on various aspects of the project.
3.  **Contribute:** If you find something unclear, have a question that isn't answered, or want to add a new guide, feel free to contribute! Good documentation is key to a successful team.

## About the `codelab`

The `codelab` folder holds all the main computer code for our project. It's like our main workshop where we build and check new parts of the application.

**What's inside and what it does:**
The `codelab` is set up with everything needed, like tools and instructions, already in place. This means you don't have to worry about getting things started. It's your dedicated space to work on the project's code.

**How you can use it:**
You can use the `codelab` to:
*   **Add new things:** Create new features or parts for the application.
*   **Fix problems:** Solve any issues or bugs you find.
*   **See how things work:** Look through the code to understand how different parts of the application fit together.
*   **Check for mistakes:** Run special checks (called tests) to make sure the code works correctly.

[For more details on how the `codelab` is put together or how to run it, please look at the

We're excited to have you on board! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
