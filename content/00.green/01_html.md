# What is HTML?

Let's go back to our house analogy for building websites:

*   If JavaScript was the "magic" that makes things work (like electricity and appliances), and CSS was the "paint and decoration" (making it look good), then **HTML is the foundation, walls, and structure of the house itself.**

## What does HTML stand for?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Let's break that down:

*   **HyperText:** This refers to the links that connect web pages. When you click on a link to go to another page, that's "HyperText" in action.
*   **Markup:** This means that HTML uses special codes (called "tags") to describe the content. It doesn't tell the browser *how* to display something in terms of style, but rather *what* something is. For example, "this is a heading," "this is a paragraph," "this is an image."
*   **Language:** It's a way for us to communicate instructions to the web browser.

## What HTML Does

HTML is the **standard language for creating web pages**. Every single webpage you visit is built using HTML. Its main job is to define the **structure and content** of a web page.

Think of it like this:
*   Without HTML, a web page would just be a blank screen.
*   HTML tells the browser things like:
    *   "This is the main title of the page."
    *   "This is a paragraph of text."
    *   "Here's an image we want to show."
    *   "This is a list of items."
    *   "This is a link to another page."

It uses opening and closing "tags" to mark up different parts of the content. For example, `<p>` is for a paragraph, `<h1>` for a main heading, and `<img>` for an image.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together

HTML is the essential starting point. It provides the *content* and *structure*.

*   **HTML:** The words, images, links, and how they are organized on the page.
*   **CSS:** Makes that content look pretty – colors, fonts, spacing.
*   **JavaScript:** Makes that content interactive – buttons that do things, animations, forms that respond.

They all work together to create the rich, dynamic websites we use every day. HTML is the backbone that holds everything together.

## Seeing Early HTML in Action

To truly appreciate how HTML forms the core of a webpage, it's interesting to look at some very early or famously simple websites. These examples often rely heavily on basic HTML structure, with minimal CSS or JavaScript, giving you a clear view of the "bones" of the page.

*   **The World Wide Web Project (1991):** This is one of the very first websites ever created, demonstrating fundamental HTML.
    *   Live Link: [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch/)

*   **Space Jam (1996):** A classic example of a 90s website, still online and largely unchanged, showcasing HTML tables for layout before CSS was widely used for this purpose.
    *   Live Link: [spacejam.com/1996](http://www.spacejam.com/1996/)

*   **The Million Dollar Homepage (2005):0:** A unique concept demonstrating how HTML could be used to structure a massive grid of images and links.

These examples are great for understanding the raw power of HTML in organizing information and creating navigation, even without modern styling or interactivity.
