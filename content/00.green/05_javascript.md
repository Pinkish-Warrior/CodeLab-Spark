# Lesson 1: What is JavaScript and Where Does It Live?

Imagine a website is like a house.

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the **frame and structure** of the house. It’s the walls, the roof, the doors, and the windows. It gives the house its basic shape.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the **decoration and paint**. It’s the color of the walls, the style of the furniture, and the pictures on the wall. It makes the house look good.
*   **JavaScript (JS)** is the **magic that makes things happen** in the house. It's the electricity, the plumbing, and all the appliances.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that brings websites to life. While HTML provides the structure and CSS provides the style, JavaScript adds interactivity. It's the "brains" of the website that responds to your actions.

Think about things you do on a website:
*   Clicking a button that shows or hides something.
*   Seeing a photo gallery that automatically slides to the next picture.
*   Getting an alert or a pop-up message.
*   Filling out a form that checks if you entered a valid email address.

All of that is JavaScript at work! It turns a static, boring page into a dynamic and interactive experience.

## Where Does JavaScript Live?

For the most part, **JavaScript lives and runs inside your web browser**.

When you visit a website, your browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) downloads three main types of files: the HTML, the CSS, and the JavaScript.

1.  The browser first reads the **HTML** to build the structure of the page.
2.  Then, it applies the **CSS** to make it look good.
3.  Finally, it runs the **JavaScript** code to handle any interactive features.

So, when you click a button on a page, it's the JavaScript code running in *your* browser that makes something happen in response. It doesn’t need to go back to the website’s server for every little interaction, which makes the website feel fast and responsive.

In short, JavaScript is the essential ingredient that makes modern websites interactive, and its home is right inside your web browser.
