Welcome to Level Green! This is the first step in your web development journey. The goal of this level is to get you comfortable with the three fundamental building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You will go through each topic, learn the core concepts, and then immediately apply that knowledge in a hands-on challenge.

## What You Will Learn

1.  **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** You'll learn what HTML is and how it's used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage.
    *   **Challenge:** You will build your very first "About Me" webpage using only HTML.

2.  **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** You'll discover how to use CSS to add style, color, and layout to your plain HTML, making it visually appealing.
    *   **Challenge:** You will take your "About Me" page and style it with colors, fonts, and spacing.

3.  **JavaScript:** You'll learn how JavaScript brings interactivity to a website, allowing you to create dynamic experiences that respond to user actions.
    *   **Challenge:** You will add a "Dark Mode" toggle button to your "About Me" page, making it fully interactive.

## How to Get Started

1.  Read `01_html.md` to understand the basics of HTML.
2.  Complete the challenge in `02_html_challenge.md` by creating your `index.html` file.
3.  Read `03_css.md` to learn how to style your page.
4.  Follow the challenge in `04_css_challenge.md` to create a `style.css` file and link it to your HTML.
5.  Read `05_javascript.md` to learn about interactivity.
6.  Finish by completing the challenge in `06_javascript_challenge.md` to create a `script.js` file and bring your page to life.

By the end of this level, you will have built a complete, styled, and interactive webpage from scratch. Good luck!
